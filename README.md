# SPRTCAsimulation
     
This repository contains code to conduct the simulation study in
“Inferring bivariate associations with continuous data from studies
using respondent-driven sampling” by Malatesta et al.      
     
Malatesta S, Jacobson KR, Carney T, Kolaczyk ED, Gile KJ, White LF. Inferring bivariate association with continuous data from a respondent-driven sample. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series C: Applied Statistics. 2024:qlae061.<https://doi.org/10.1093/jrsssc/qlae061>
      
In this paper, we present the Semi-parametric randomization test for continuous
association (SPRTCA). SPRTCA was developed to infer bivariate
association between two variables collected using respondent-driven
sampling (RDS) when one or both variables are continuous.      
     
To apply SPRTCA to your data, please see the R package we developed that
is available at <https://github.com/samalatesta/RDSAssociation>.
