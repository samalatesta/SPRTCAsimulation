# SPRTCAsimulation

This repository contains code to conduct the simulation study in
“Inferring bivariate associations with continuous data from studies
using respondent-driven sampling” by Malatesta et al. In this paper, we
present the Semi-parametric randomization test for continuous
association (SPRTCA). SPRTCA was developed to infer bivariate
association between two variables collected using respondent-driven
sampling (RDS) when one or both variables are continuous.

To apply SPRTCA to your data, please see the R package we developed that
is available on github at
<https://github.com/samalatesta/RDSAssociation>.
